										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Information security management is basically based on 3 main elements. These are the technology process and human trio. The concept we call technology consists of information technology applications and hardware. In other words, we have firewall, servers, antivirus systems, log systems, mail gateway and applications. When it comes to security, technology often comes to mind, but technology alone is not enough. You get a firewall, but if you do not determine your processes or policies correctly in this firewall and do not employ competent personnel for this firewall, you cannot fully provide security.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The course aims to briefly increase the network structure and communication, and then increase the general knowledge level about cryptology. Then it gives information about linux commands and linux directories and permissions. After these parts, the tools used in the attack phase and the methodology of the attack are shown to all our students in practice. At the end of the training, you will be able to find answers to questions such as how a system can be hacked, web application attack techniques and vulnerabilities, network attacks, password attacks, information in the passive and active information collection phase, and how to exploit. During the course, many hacking operations will be carried out on two target machines in practice.</p>
