										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is an &#8220;Introduction to Cyber ​​Security&#8221; training, not a white/black hat hacker or penetration test training. (Hands-on hacking, penetration testing, password cracking, etc. are not done in the training). The aim of the training is to provide you with useful information such as the basic concepts of cyber security, popular attack and defense techniques, to create a vision and to enable you to enter the world of cyber security.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Information security management is basically based on 3 main elements. These are the technology process and human trio. The concept we call technology consists of information technology applications and hardware. In other words, we have firewall, servers, antivirus systems, log systems, mail gateway and applications. When it comes to security, technology often comes to mind, but technology alone is not enough. You get a firewall, but if you do not determine your processes or policies correctly in this firewall and do not employ competent personnel for this firewall, you cannot fully provide security.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The course content addresses the Offensive section of Cyber ​​Security. Friends who want to improve themselves in the offensive field and become an Ethical Hacker will be able to learn useful information from this course.</p>
<p>I did not tailor the tutorial format entirely for Udemy. I have included some of the trainings I have given online before in this course. For this reason, you can see expressions in the form of questions and answers in some videos. The reason I didn&#8217;t remove them was because you might ask such a question. If you have the same question, your question may have been answered in the video.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The course aims to briefly increase the network structure and communication, and then increase the general knowledge level about cryptology. Then it gives information about linux commands and linux directories and permissions. After these parts, the tools used in the attack phase and the methodology of the attack are shown to all our students in practice. At the end of the training, you will be able to find answers to questions such as how a system can be hacked, web application attack techniques and vulnerabilities, network attacks, password attacks, information in the passive and active information collection phase, and how to exploit. During the course, many hacking operations will be carried out on two target machines in practice.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Individuals working in the field of system management, network and information security should have information about cyber attacks, both individually and institutionally. In this training, logical and hardware security solutions that can be applied to protect against cyber attacks, legal processes and cyber attacks are covered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every individual working in institutions should have a good level of awareness in the field of cyber security and information security. 80% of successful attacks against companies are from inside. In other words, every individual should have cyber security awareness in order to be protected from attacks caused by the mistakes of company personnel. The content in this training has been prepared completely in accordance with this.</p>
