										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Information security management is basically based on 3 main elements. These are the technology process and human trio. The concept we call technology consists of information technology applications and hardware. In other words, we have firewall, servers, antivirus systems, log systems, mail gateway and applications. When it comes to security, technology often comes to mind, but technology alone is not enough. You get a firewall, but if you do not determine your processes or policies correctly in this firewall and do not employ competent personnel for this firewall, you cannot fully provide security.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The course content addresses the Offensive section of Cyber ​​Security. Friends who want to improve themselves in the offensive field and become an Ethical Hacker will be able to learn useful information from this course.</p>
<p>I did not tailor the tutorial format entirely for Udemy. I have included some of the trainings I have given online before in this course. For this reason, you can see expressions in the form of questions and answers in some videos. The reason I didn&#8217;t remove them was because you might ask such a question. If you have the same question, your question may have been answered in the video.</p>
